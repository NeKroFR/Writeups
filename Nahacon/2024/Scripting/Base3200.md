# Base3200 - 50

The challenge names is Base3200 and it provide us a [theflag (1)](https://ctf.nahamcon.com/files/a04b1ca2f8656d078cdc885a7b1b14ba/theflag.xz?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1ODk1LCJ0ZWFtX2lkIjozMDUyLCJmaWxlX2lkIjo3Nn0.ZlSdPg.czjDlzm-X6peWfmSw5mOWGMVU-w) file with some base64 content. 
My first guess was that it was encoded in base32 a 100 times, however I had a padding error, so it was not base32.

```py
from base64 import b32decode

ct = open('theflag (1)', 'r').read()

for i in range(50):
    ct = b32decode(ct)
print(ct)
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/nk0/Desktop/nahacon/Scripting/Base3200.py", line 6, in <module>
    ct = b32decode(ct)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/base64.py", line 253, in b32decode
    return _b32decode(_b32alphabet, s, casefold, map01)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/base64.py", line 209, in _b32decode
    raise binascii.Error('Incorrect padding')
binascii.Error: Incorrect padding
```

So I tryed to decode it from base64 50 times and it worked:

```py
from base64 import b64decode

ct = open('theflag (1)', 'r').read()

for i in range(50):
    ct = b64decode(ct)
print(ct)
```
