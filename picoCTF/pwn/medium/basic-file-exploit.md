Looking at the source code we can see that they use the `strtol` function on our input and check if it return 0.

```c
static void data_read() {
  char entry[4];
  long entry_number;
  char output[100];
  int r;

  memset(output, '\0', 100);
  
  printf("Please enter the entry number of your data:\n");
  r = tgetinput(entry, 4);
  // Timeout on user input
  if(r == -3)
  {
    printf("Goodbye!\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }

  entry_number--;
  strncpy(output, data[entry_number], input_lengths[entry_number]);
  puts(output);
}
```


Looking at the man page, we can see that it takes our input and return an integer.

```
DESCRIPTION
       The  strtol() function converts the initial part of the string in nptr to a long integer value according to the given base, which must be between 2 and 36 inclu‐
       sive, or be the special value 0.

```

We can easily retrieve the flag sending a 0 to the remote:
