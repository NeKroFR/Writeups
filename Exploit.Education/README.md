# WELCOME TO EXPLOIT.EDUCATION

[exploit.education](https://exploit.education/) provides a variety of resources that can be used to learn about vulnerability analysis, exploit development, software debugging, binary analysis, and general cyber security issues.

## Nebula

[Nebula](https://exploit.education/nebula/) covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.

Nebula is an ideal place to get started for people new to Linux exploitation.

## Phoenix

[Phoenix](https://exploit.education/phoenix/) introduces basic memory corruption issues such as buffer overflows, format strings and heap exploitation under “old-style” Linux system that does not have any form of modern exploit mitigation systems enabled. It has both 32 bit and 64 bit levels available, for both X86 and ARM systems.

## Fusion

[Fusion](https://exploit.education/fusion/) continues the memory corruption, format strings and heap exploitation but this time focusing on more advanced scenarios and modern protection systems.
